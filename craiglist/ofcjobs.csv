I'm the President and CEO of bwpcareers.com and I've got an exciting opportunity for a few new motivated professionals from your area that would like to immediately average $1800-$3000 PER WEEK in the \""easy to learn, easy to earn\"" recruiting business."",""\n"",""\nFirst things first...I know you've probably seen and heard it all before. You've heard all the empty and broken promises. You've heard all the bait and switch approaches a thousand times. Companies that promise a \""great opportunity\"" but want your hard earned money before you can get started. And by now you're sick of it all. All you want to do is earn a living and an income that affords you the opportunity to enjoy your life and do more for yourself and your family than just pay bills and get by. I know because I've been there before myself and I know exactly how it feels which is why the first thing I want to do is separate myself and my company by saying, \""this is not any of that at all, not even close\"". This is a real contract position and a real job where you can make great money fast and we will never ask for any money for any reason ever!!! So leave your concerns behind and focus on what you're about to read.

In addition they'll never ever be asked to do any cold calling of any kind, no door to door, no telemarketing and they will make very good money!!! Again, my client provides the sales representatives that you're hiring with 100% of their appointments. No cold calling of any kind will ever be required by the sales representatives you're hiring. Furthermore, my client will pay their gas money to run their first 10 appointments. All of that only makes your job as a Virtual Recruiter with bwpcareers.com even easier.

And if you don't have any recruiting experience at all, that's not a problem. Simply put, your job as a Recruiter is giving people a job for a living. It's that easy!!! Our average recruiter hires 6-10 new sales representatives per week. I also have recruiters who hire 15-20 new sales representatives per week times $300.00 per hire!!! Does that sound like the kind of money you want to be making? "",""\n"",""\nObviously there's a great deal of money to be made as a Virtual Sales Recruiter here with us at bwpcareers.com.
